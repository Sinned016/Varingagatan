Working on a forum / book page for my dad Leif Selander.
I haven't really thought about the design yet so it's not very pretty but i'll post progress pictures below of hows it's going and how it looks like.

# Progress List
- #1 Setting up a project with React router. ✅

- #3 Creating an account with alot of inputs (name, password, email, age, language etc..) ✅
- #4 Signing in with email and password (matching with the database) or with google. ✅
- #5 Be able to sign in as an admin (admin will have access to other things. Like deleting comments etc..) ✅
- #6 Make a header where you can navigate to different places on the page and check if the user is logged in or admin. ✅
